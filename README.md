# Tensorflow Extended (TFX) pipeline for ML
## A jupyter notebook to run a machine learning pipeline using Tensorflow Extended (TFX) 


## Stages

1. Preprocessing: Split data into train, test sets using examplegen
2. Generate schema using schemagen
3. Validator: Perform data validation
4. Transformer: Transform into usable input for training
2. Trainer: Train regression model
3. Evaluator: Evaluate model performance metrics on eval set
4. Pusher: Export model for serving
